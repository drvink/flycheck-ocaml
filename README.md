flycheck-ocaml â€” Flycheck for OCaml
===================================

[![License GPL 3][badge-license]][copying]

Add OCaml support to [Flycheck][]:

- Add a `ocaml-merlin` syntax checker using [Merlin][]

Installation
------------

As usual, from [MELPA][] or [MELPA Stable][].

In your [`Cask`][cask] file:

```cl
(source gnu)
(source melpa)

(depends-on "flycheck-ocaml")
```

In your `init.el`:

```cl
(with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
  (require 'flycheck-ocaml))

(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook #'merlin-mode)
```

Usage
-----

Just use Flycheck as usual in Tuareg Mode buffers.  Flycheck will automatically
use the new `ocaml-merlin` syntax checker if Merlin Mode is enabled.
